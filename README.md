# TASK -2 COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-WORKFLOW - DESCRIPTION :

As part of this assignment, I was tasked with simulating a collaborative design workflow in Figma, which included the creation and sharing of a project with a teammate,
engaging in real-time collaboration through comments, and showcasing version control throughout the design process. This exercise was designed to mirror a professional design environment, where multiple team members work together seamlessly within a shared digital space.

To begin, I created a new file in Figma and gave it a suitable title representing our design session. Within the canvas, I used various Figma tools to build a sample layout, incorporating a mix of basic shapes, frames, text, and other components. The goal here was not just to create a visually appealing design, 
but to provide a base on which collaborative interactions could be demonstrated effectively.

After setting up the initial design framework, I proceeded to the collaboration phase by inviting a teammate to the project using her email ID.
I ensured that she was granted editing access, which would allow her to freely interact with the design elements, suggest changes, and provide feedback.
Once she joined, our shared session was active, and we could see each other’s cursors in real-time.

One of the first collaboration tools we used was the Spotlight feature. This allowed either of us to click on each other’s profile icons and instantly follow 
the other’s actions on the canvas. This was particularly useful when one of us wanted to demonstrate a specific layout change or highlight a design area without
needing to verbally explain where to look.

Next, we shifted into commenting mode (using the C key or comment tool), where we began exchanging feedback by placing comments directly on specific elements of the design. 
For example, my teammate left a note on a shape requesting a color change, while I commented on text alignment in one section. These comments were immediately visible, 
and we were able to reply to each other in real-time, mimicking a live design review session.

We also took advantage of live editing, where both of us modified elements on the canvas simultaneously. My teammate edited the frame layout and changed some component colors, 
while I adjusted the text placement and grouped several shapes together for cleaner organization. The real-time updates and live previewing helped us quickly iterate through multiple design ideas without needing to export or refresh anything.

Finally, to showcase how the design evolved over time, we accessed the Version History feature (via File → Show Version History). Here, I manually saved and labeled two specific
design states: one before collaboration ("Initial Layout") and one after ("Final Collaborative Layout"). This feature clearly demonstrated how our file progressed and allowed us to compare the changes easily. If needed, we could also restore an earlier version with just a click.

Throughout this process, I utilized Figma’s key features such as:

 - > Shapes, lines, frames, and text tools for visual structure

 - > Auto Layout to keep components aligned and responsive

 - > Grouping and layering for clean design organization

 - > Real-time editing and comment threads for communication

 - > Version history to track and manage progress

This project not only allowed me to explore Figma’s collaboration tools in depth but also emphasized the importance of teamwork in digital design environments. It demonstrated how powerful real-time collaboration, combined with visual version control, can significantly improve the speed and clarity of the design process. The ability to leave contextual feedback, edit live, and track progress made the whole experience feel close to working in a professional product or UI/UX team.

In conclusion, this assignment helped me develop hands-on experience in collaborative design workflows. By simulating a live design session with a teammate, I was able to practice both design skills and soft skills like communication, feedback handling, and documentation. It reinforced Figma's role not just as a design tool, but as a complete platform for design collaboration.
